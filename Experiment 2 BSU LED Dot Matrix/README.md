# Experiment 2: Alphanumeric LCD Display (LCD1602)

This experiment demonstrates how to wire up and initialize an LCD screen to display text and dynamic data.

### Description
The system uses a 16x2 Alphanumeric LCD Display to show characters on the screen. The display is wired to the Arduino's digital pins to receive data and instructions, while a 10k Potentiometer is used to manually adjust the screen's contrast. In this setup, the display outputs a static "Hello, World!" message on the top row and a live timer counting the seconds since the program started on the bottom row. 



### Components Used
* 1x Elegoo Uno R3
* 1x LCD1602 Module
* 1x 10k Potentiometer
* 1x 830 tie-points Breadboard
* 16x M-M wires (Male to Male jumper wires)
