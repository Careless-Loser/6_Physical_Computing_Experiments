Introduction to Physical Computing
**Physical Computing** is the field of building interactive systems that sense and respond to the analog world using a combination of software and hardware. Unlike traditional computing, which relies on screens and keyboards, physical computing uses sensors (to "feel" the environment) and actuators (to "act" upon it).

Project Development and Experimentation

### Experiment 1: Car Sensor Automatic Gate
This experiment simulates an automated parking garage or driveway entry system.

#### **Description**
The system uses an **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor** to detect an approaching vehicle. When the car comes within a specific range (e.g., 20cm in simulation), a **Servo Motor** rotates 90 degrees to lift the gate arm. After a 5-second delay, the gate automatically closes.

#### **Components Used**
* 1x Arduino Uno R3
* 1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
* 1x SG90 Servo Motor
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires 9 (male to male)
