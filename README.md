Introduction to Physical Computing
**Physical Computing** is the field of building interactive systems that sense and respond to the analog world using a combination of software and hardware. Unlike traditional computing, which relies on screens and keyboards, physical computing uses sensors (to "feel" the environment) and actuators (to "act" upon it).
