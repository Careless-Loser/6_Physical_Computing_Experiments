### Experiment 1: Car Sensor Automatic Gate
This experiment simulates an automated parking garage or driveway entry system.

#### **Description**
The system uses an **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor** to detect an approaching vehicle. When the car comes within a specific range (e.g., 20cm in simulation), a **Servo Motor** rotates 90 degrees to lift the gate arm. After a 5-second delay, the gate automatically closes.

#### **Components Used**
* 1x Arduino Uno R3
* 1x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
* 1x SG90 Servo Motor
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires 9 (male to male)
