## Experiment 3: RGB LED Overview

This experiment explores color mixing and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) by cycling through the color spectrum using an RGB LED.

### Description
RGB LEDs are a versatile way to add color to projects by combining Red, Green, and Blue light within a single package. This experiment covers how to connect the LED (Common Cathode or Common Anode) using current-limiting resistors for each color channel. 

### Components Required
* 1x Elegoo Uno R3
* 1x 830 Tie Points Breadboard
* 4x M-M wires (Male to Male jumper wires)
* 1x RGB LED
* 3x 220 ohm resistors
